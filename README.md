# uebersicht-ShowTags

Widget to display tags stored in a file for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

I prefer to add 'tags' to my filenames to keep them in place when exchanging them with other people or across machines and platforms.

To avoid ending up with various synonyms or spell variations of the same tag, I've created a simple text file that has all the tags I currently use.

To reduce space I've put the tags two on a single line, separated with a tab character (\t).

There is an example file in this widget.
